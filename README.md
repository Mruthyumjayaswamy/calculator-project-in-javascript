# calculator-project-in-javascript
i'm exciting mini-project where I focused on developing and implementing core logical functions. Enthusiastic about the clean, functional logic built here!
Features
Basic Arithmetic: Performs standard addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Logical Implementation: Uses JavaScript's built-in switch statement for handling different operations cleanly.

Control Flow Mastery: Demonstrates effective use of control flow (if/else and loops, if applicable) for input validation and operation execution.

Modular Design: Implemented using reusable functions for clear, organized, and maintainable code.

User Interface: A straightforward interface for inputting numbers and selecting an operation.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the calculator interface.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript (Vanilla): The core language used for all logic and functionality, focusing on:

Functions

switch statements

Conditional statements (if/else)

Control flow
